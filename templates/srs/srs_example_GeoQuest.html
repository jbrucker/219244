<blockquote>
  <h3><a name="1.1"></a>1.1 Purpose of this Document</h3>
  <p>The purpose of this Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document is
  to give an overview the requirements for the Adventures in Geometry project.&nbsp; The
  SRS will define how our team and the client envision the final product and the
  characteristics or functionality it must have. We note&nbsp; interface or
  implementation requirements as well as product functionality that is desired
  but not absolutely necessary.</p>
  <h3><a name="1.2"></a>1.2 Scope of the Development Project</h3>
  <p>The product will be a web-based application to assist elementary school
  children (specifically, 6th graders) with concepts of geometry.</p>
  <h3><a name="1.3"></a>1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>BROWSER:</b> A browser is an application program that provides a way
      to look at and interact with all the information on the World Wide Web.
      The word &quot;browser&quot; seems to have originated prior to the Web as
      a generic term for user interfaces that let you browse <a class="inline" href="http://www.whatis.com/WhatIs_Definition_Page/0,4152,213125,00.html">text</a>
      files online. By the time the first Web browser with a <a class="inline" href="http://www.whatis.com/WhatIs_Definition_Page/0,4152,213989,00.html">graphical
      user interface</a> was invented (Mosaic, in 1992), the term seemed to
      apply to Web content, too. Technically, a Web browser is a client program
      that uses the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (<a class="inline" href="http://www.whatis.com/WhatIs_Definition_Page/0,4152,214004,00.html">Hypertext
      Transfer Protocol</a>) to make requests of Web servers throughout the
      Internet on behalf of the browser user. A commercial version of the
      original browser, <a class="inline" href="http://www.whatis.com/WhatIs_Definition_Page/0,4152,212593,00.html">Mosaic</a>,
      is in use. Many of the user interface features in Mosaic, however, went
      into the first widely-used browser, <a class="inline" href="http://www.whatis.com/WhatIs_Definition_Page/0,4152,212640,00.html">Netscape</a>
      Navigator. Microsoft followed with its <a class="inline" href="http://www.whatis.com/WhatIs_Definition_Page/0,4152,214105,00.html">Microsoft
      Internet Explorer</a>. Today, these two browsers are highly competitive
      and the only two browsers that the vast majority of Internet users are
      aware of. Although the online services, such as America Online, Compuserve,
      and Prodigy, originally had their own browsers, virtually all now offer
      the Netscape or Microsoft browser. <a class="inline" href="http://www.whatis.com/WhatIs_Definition_Page/0,4152,212505,00.html">Lynx</a>
      is a text-only browser for UNIX shell and VMS users. Another recently
      offered browser is <a class="inline" href="http://www.whatis.com/WhatIs_Definition_Page/0,4152,212712,00.html">Opera</a>.
    <li><b>COOKIE:</b> A cookie is information that a <a class="inline" href="http://www.whatis.com/WhatIs_Definition_Page/0,4152,213352,00.html">Web
      site</a> puts on your <a class="inline" href="http://www.whatis.com/WhatIs_Definition_Page/0,4152,212227,00.html">hard
      disk</a> so that it can remember something about you at a later time.
      (More technically, it is information for future use that is stored by the <a class="inline" href="http://www.whatis.com/WhatIs_Definition_Page/0,4152,212964,00.html">server</a>
      on the <a class="inline" href="http://www.whatis.com/WhatIs_Definition_Page/0,4152,211795,00.html">client</a>
      side of a <a href="http://www.whatis.com/WhatIs_Search_Results_Exact/clientse.htm">client/server</a>
      communication.) Typically, a cookie records your preferences when using a
      particular site. Using the Web's Hypertext Transfer Protocol (<a class="inline" href="http://www.whatis.com/WhatIs_Definition_Page/0,4152,214004,00.html">Hypertext
      Transfer Protocol</a>), each request for a Web page is independent of all
      other requests. For this reason, the Web page server has no memory of what
      pages it has sent to a user previously or anything about your previous
      visits. A cookie is a mechanism that allows the <a class="inline" href="http://www.whatis.com/WhatIs_Definition_Page/0,4152,212964,00.html">server</a>
      to store its own information about a user on the user's own computer. You
      can view the cookies that have been stored on your hard disk (although the
      content stored in each cookie may not make much sense to you). The
      location of the cookies depends on the browser. Internet Explorer stores
      each cookie as a separate file under a Windows subdirectory. Netscape
      stores all cookies in a single cookies.txt fle. <a class="inline" href="http://www.whatis.com/WhatIs_Definition_Page/0,4152,212712,00.html">Opera</a>
      stores them in a single cookies.dat file.
    <li><b>GUI:</b> A GUI (usually pronounced <font size="-1">GOO-ee</font>) is
      a graphical (rather than purely textual) user interface to a computer. As
      you read this, you are looking at the GUI or graphical user interface of
      your particular Web <a class="inline" href="http://www.whatis.com/WhatIs_Definition_Page/0,4152,211708,00.html">browser</a>.
      The term came into existence because the first interactive user interfaces
      to computers were not graphical; they were text-and-keyboard oriented and
      usually consisted of commands you had to remember and computer responses
      that were infamously brief. The command interface of the <a class="inline" href="http://www.whatis.com/WhatIs_Definition_Page/0,4152,213911,00.html">Disk
      Operating System</a> operating system (which you can still get to from
      your Windows operating system) is an example of the typical user-computer
      interface before GUIs arrived. An intermediate step in user interfaces
      between the command line interface and the GUI was the non-graphical <i>menu-based
      interface</i>, which let you interact by using a <a class="inline" href="http://www.whatis.com/WhatIs_Definition_Page/0,4152,212596,00.html">mouse</a>
      rather than by having to type in keyboard commands.
    <li><b>HTML: </b>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the set of &quot;<a class="inline" href="http://www.whatis.com/WhatIs_Definition_Page/0,4152,212527,00.html">markup</a>&quot;
      symbols or codes inserted in a file intended for display on a World Wide
      Web <a class="inline" href="http://www.whatis.com/WhatIs_Definition_Page/0,4152,211708,00.html">browser</a>.
      The markup tells the Web browser how to display a Web page's words and
      images for the user. The individual markup codes are referred to as
      elements (but many people also refer to them as <a class="inline" href="http://www.whatis.com/WhatIs_Definition_Page/0,4152,213087,00.html">tag</a>).
    <li><b>JAVASCRIPT:</b> JavaScript is an <a class="inline" href="http://www.whatis.com/WhatIs_Definition_Page/0,4152,212373,00.html">interpreted</a>
      programming or <a class="inline" href="http://www.whatis.com/WhatIs_Definition_Page/0,4152,212948,00.html">script</a>
      language from Netscape. It is somewhat similar in capability to
      Microsoft's <a class="inline" href="http://www.whatis.com/WhatIs_Definition_Page/0,4152,213309,00.html">Visual
      Basic</a>, Sun's <a class="inline" href="http://www.whatis.com/WhatIs_Definition_Page/0,4152,214196,00.html">Tool
      Command Language</a>, the UNIX-derived <a class="inline" href="http://www.whatis.com/WhatIs_Definition_Page/0,4152,214291,00.html">Practical
      Extraction and Reporting Language</a>, and IBM's <a class="inline" href="http://www.whatis.com/WhatIs_Definition_Page/0,4152,214262,00.html">Restructured
      Extended Executor</a>. In general, script languages are easier and faster
      to code in than the more structured and <a class="inline" href="http://www.whatis.com/WhatIs_Definition_Page/0,4152,211824,00.html">compiler</a>
      languages such as <a class="inline" href="http://www.whatis.com/WhatIs_Definition_Page/0,4152,211723,00.html">C</a>
      and <a class="inline" href="http://www.whatis.com/WhatIs_Definition_Page/0,4152,211850,00.html">C++</a>.
      Script languages generally take longer to process than compiled languages,
      but are very useful for shorter programs.</li>

  <h3><a name="2.2"></a>2.2 Product Perspective</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>This project is an extension to the GeoQuest of Fall, 98. It is a
      web-based application.
    <li>Application will interact with a text reader to assist users who have
      visual disabilities
    <li>It consists of a graphical user interface written in Java, JavaScript,
      HTML, or a combination of these.
    <li>
      <p>The product is web accessible and must work with the client's existing
      hardware. A web browser like Netscape 4.0+ or Internet Explorer 4.0+ will
      be needed.</p>
    <li>
      <p>Requires sound card and appropriate audio equipment.</p>
    <li>
      <p>Computers will need Internet access with a connection speed of at least
      28.8 for decent download of information like pictures and sound. Our
      product can run locally if all the source files are on the local machine.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3><a name="2.3"></a>2.3 Overview of Functional Requirements</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p class="MsoNormal">A product main page will present the objective of the
      game and state requirements for running the game. It will also include a
      link to start the program.<O:P>
      </O:P>
      </p>
    <li>
      <p class="MsoNormal">An introductory page will introduce the setting of
      the game and state the mission of the apprentices. This page will allow
      users to choose between adventure mode and tutorial mode.<O:P>
      </O:P>
      </p>
    <li>
      <p class="MsoNormal">The tutorial mode will offer lessons and practice
      problems similar to those asked in the game mode.</p>
    <li>
      <p class="MsoNormal">During the game mode, the users will be asked a
      series of geometry questions. If the questions are answered correctly, the
      user will be allowed to proceed. Once the users answer three questions
      incorrectly, the game is over.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
    <li>
      <p class="MsoNormal">The questions in the game mode will be different each
      time a new game is started.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3><a name="2.4"></a>2.4 Overview of Data Requirements</h3>
  <p class="MsoNormal">A user sends inputs to the software program by either
  typing keys or clicking on the mouse. The user will have an option to choose
  either the tutorial mode or to start the game by clicking on the appropriate
  icon. The user will navigate the tutorial pages by clicking on the mouse
  button. The quiz questions can be answered by either entering or selecting
  numbers.<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">In the adventure mode, the user will traverse a series of
  frames that pose questions requiring input from either a click-able image map,
  a text/numerical value entered from the keyboard, or a series of
  multiple-choice options in the form of radio buttons.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>This input will be recorded and, if correct, the user will be
  transferred from the current frame to the next frame in the adventure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>If incorrect for the third time, the game is over.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">In the knowledge assessment mode, there will be comments
  for both correct and incorrect answers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For
  example, when the user answers a question correctly they might get a brief
  message on their screen, whereas an incorrect answer might give the user two
  more chances and and then an option to go to the tutorial mode. The
  student’s score will also be output to the screen as an indicator of his/her
  performance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Sound will be
  incorporated as part of our enhancement techniques, which should make the game
  more interesting to the children.</p>

      Netscape Navigator version 4.0+.<O:P>
      </O:P>
      </p>
    <li>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Ideally, the computer will have Internet connection.
      However, the product should work without Internet connection if copies of
      the product are stored in local hard drives.<O:P>
      </O:P>
      </p>
    <li>
      <p class="MsoNormal">File size will need to be considered with
      incorporation of sound or music.</p>

      Interface: </b>At the start of the game the user will be asked to login
      his/her name. After logging in the user will be given the option of going
      into the tutorial mode or starting the game. There will be two buttons:
      Tutorial Mode and Start Game.
      <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent">The game page will have two or three frames
      (one for picture, one for text directions, and another for menu options).
      Our user interface is designed to be primarily mouse driven in order to
      facilitate ease of use. The mouse will be used to allow the user to
      navigate through out the game and to select answers to questions. There
      are some questions where the answers have to be typed in.</p>
    <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo4; tab-stops: list .5in; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto"><b>Hardware
      Components:</b> The game will be able to run if the computer is at least a
      PowerPC Macintosh or a Pentium-class PC, 32 MB of RAM, and has a color
      display.<br>
    <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo4; tab-stops: list .5in; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto"><b>Software
      Components:</b> A web browser, either Internet Explorer 4.0+ or Netscape
      4.0+, will be necessary. To hear the sound the user would need to have the
      proper plug-in for the browser, but this is not a requirement. If the user
      does not have the plug-in, he/she will not hear the sound but will still
      be able to play the game. The program has no other software requirements.&nbsp;</li>

  <ul style="MARGIN-TOP: 0in" type="disc">
    <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list: l3 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in">The
      user will run the product from the s2s web site hosted by The University
      of Texas at Austin's Computer Science Department. The number of
      connections to the system depends on the UT CS department web server
      configuration and capability. However, the user will be able to run the
      program locally by installing all the source files on his hard drive or on
      a CD.
    <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list: l3 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in">GeoQuest
      is a web-based stand-alone application. Multiple users should be able to
      run the software simultaneously as long as the number of connections to
      the web server does not exceed the configuration limit. However, the more
      the number of users on the system, the less performance every user
      experiences while using the product.
    <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list: l3 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in">GeoQuest
      will load up graphics and sounds on every page and will also open up
      windows using JavaScript on the runtime. The response time for loading
      every page depends mostly on the Internet connection speed and also data
      transmission bandwidth. The response time may be longer when used with a
      slow connection. For this reason, future enhancement of the product should
      avoid incorporating unnecessary graphics and sound files on the HTML page.
    <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list: l3 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in">Response
      time of interactive transaction should not exceed 2 seconds per
      transaction. However, it may vary depending on the client’s system
      configuration.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3><a name="3.4"></a>3.4 Quality Attributes</h3>
  <ul style="MARGIN-TOP: 0in" type="disc">
    <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list: l2 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: list .5in">The
      availability of the product solely depends on the availability of the web
      server of UT CS department. Generally speaking, the product should be
      available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.
    <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list: l2 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: list .5in">GeoQuest
      should be a very reliable product since it does not require interaction
      with the local system it is running on. For an example, the software does
      not open up any external files on the local system. The product is
      expected to run smoothly without crashing the browser or the system.
    <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list: l2 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: list .5in">The
      product is maintained by good documentation of code and instructions for
      end users.</li>
